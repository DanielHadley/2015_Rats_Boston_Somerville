There are multiple uncovered garbage barrels in the FRONT AND BACK of the property.  We continue to have rodents in the area.  There are several holes visible in the garbage bags (seem in attached photos) where rodents and other animals have eaten through to access food.  This problem has been brought to the attention of the City countless times.  The owner of the property (NOT the tenants) MUST BE FINED continuously in order to combat these unacceptable conditions!!!  Why are we left to deal with these squalid conditions on a weekly basis???

On a daily basis we have watched 5-10 rats at a time go right into the structure through a hole at the back of the market, which serves produce for human consumption.  The backyard is a total mess, with a dead tree (that we have separately requested be removed due to the safety risk) contributing to heavy underbrush, and open containers of trash in the yard and immediately inside the open door to the market where we have seen the rats enter.  Our backyard faces theirs, and though we've tried numerous alternatives to keep the rats out (wire netting around our fence, all trash totally sealed), it is simply not safe to walk out there anymore.

We see rats constantly around the fence area at dusk and during the night time. We have called out a professional exterminator for his insight and he said that the origin of the rats is on Mr Tauro's side of the fence. He also stated that the bait box we were given by Mr Tauro was designed for mice, not rats. This bait box has not been re filled since it was first set, even though Mr Tauro said that he would do so.

We've informed our landlord of the problem and asked that they reimburse us for the $165 fee paid to the exterminator, as well as to take additional preventative measures to ensure that no further infestations occur. Unfortunately, our landlords are not fluent in English, and communicating with them is quite difficult. They are saying that they do not want to pay the fee and they have their own solution to the rat problem. In the past, when we found mice in our apartment, they told us to get a cat. We subsequently solved the problem using rat poison, which we paid for ourselves. My roommate, who paid the extermination fee, offered to deduct it from her rent check next month, but the landlords have deemedthis unacceptable.

Many rats in the Dresden Circle residential area about 4 weeks ago. Neighbors joined to hire an exterminator, at our own expense, for 3 weeks now. The number of reported rats decreased in the last week, but still evidence of rodents. There is a dumpster behind these restaurants in the City parking lot which is habitually left open. At times, the trash bags fall out of the dumpster to the ground. I have taken photos of this, 4 times, on 16, 21, 23 & 25 Sept. I would like the City to enforce the rodent prevention ordinances for this dumpster. We the neighbors are scrupulous about keeping our trash bins closed tight. It is frustrating that we must shell out $500+ on rodent control when our efforts will be useless (and $ wasted) if the City does not enforce the rodent control ordinances for the restaurants in the area.","02144","6","SR","N","1",6,5,"10/01/2012","-"

So the solution is do nothing.This is a very serious problem and it needs to be addressed.

Exterminator came out second time, 10/2, and put traps around the house since the rodents had been getting into our cabinets in the kitchen, etc.  One trap caught something, which we determined was definitely a rat.
